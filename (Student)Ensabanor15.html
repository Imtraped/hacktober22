    <h2>Ensabanor15, Letter Combinations of a Phone Number(LeetCode Problem)</h2>
    <p> Python3 </p>
    <p>This code wants you to to take a string using the digits 2-9 and each of these digits have a few letters assigned to them like a phone and when these numbers are 
    put in the code will return all possible string combinations and there could be a maximum of 4 digits printed but they can only be 2-9. 
     This problem was solved using a key and for loops allowing all possible combinations of the letters.
    </p>
